# About
This project started as a funny way to connect with friends in 2020, and it barely evolved a bit.
It's a really simple bot for Telegram, to help play DnD remotely and have a really simple chatbot with some funny and internal jokes.
Uploaded as a pet project to explore some API integrations, and some internal group jokes.
